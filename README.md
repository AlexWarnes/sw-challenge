Hello there!

This prototype application uses `json-server` as a mock API and database. 

To make things simpler, **you should run it locally with `npm start`** which will do two important things:

1. start `json-server` so you'll have data to look at
2. prevent Angular from recompiling when files change to avoid restarting `json-server` while requests are pending

## NGRX
This was my first experience with NGRX. It was fun to play around with! The patterns felt familiar having used Redux in the past, but there were several instances where I felt stuck or confused.

## Testing
I ran out of time. Testing is something I'm less familiar with, and I wanted to put more effort into areas that would show my strengths. I didn't want to ask for an extension just to learn/write tests, but rest assured I would like to learn more.

## D3
I used plain ol' D3. I _wanted_ to use plain D3 and then a library like `ngx-graphs` or `ngx-charts` but they have peer dependency conflicts with Angular 12. I thought a force-directed graph would be a nice touch but didn't want to downgrade Angular just to make it work.

## Thank you
I'm really looking foward to your feedback and discussing the code futher.
